# Asteroid Dodge

## Project Overview:

Asteroid Dodge is an arcade-style game where you control a spaceship, dodging a relentless barrage of falling asteroids. Survive as long as you can to achieve the highest score! Built with PixiJS for rendering and React for structure and game logic, this project combines retro arcade fun with modern web development techniques.

## Features:

*   **Intuitive Controls:** Steer your spaceship with simple left and right arrow key controls (←, →).
*   **Dynamic Asteroid Generation:** Asteroids spawn randomly from above, increasing the challenge as you survive longer.
*   **Precise Collision Detection:** The game accurately detects collisions between your spaceship and the asteroids, ending the game with a satisfying impact.
*   **Score Tracking:** Your score climbs as you evade asteroids, rewarding skillful play and long-term survival.
*   **Quick Restart:** Jump right back into the action with a simple restart feature after the game ends.
*   **Engaging Animations:** Enjoy basic animations that enhance the visual experience, bringing the game to life.
*   **Optimized Performance:** Experience smooth gameplay even with hundreds of asteroids on screen, thanks to careful optimization.

## Technologies Used:

*   **PixiJS:** A blazing-fast 2D rendering engine that powers the game's graphics.
*   **React:** A powerful JavaScript library for building the user interface and managing game state.
*   **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** For smooth and efficient animations.

## Installation:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DaviGuerra/asteroid-dodge.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project folder:**

    ```bash
    cd asteroid-dodge
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Gameplay:

*   **Objective:** Dodge the falling asteroids and survive as long as possible.
*   **Controls:** Use the left and right arrow keys (←, →) to move the spaceship horizontally.
*   **Game Over:** The game ends when the spaceship collides with an asteroid.
*   **Scoring:** Your score is determined by your survival time.

## Key Features to Explore:

*   **Randomized Asteroid Generation:** There are ramdon asteroid generation for the size, direction and velocity.
*   **Collision Detection Implementation:** Collision detection algorithms that ensure accurate gameplay.
*   **Score Tracking System:** The game tracks and displays your score.
*   **Game Restart Mechanism:** The game resets and prepares for a new round.
*   **Performance Optimization Techniques:** The game is optmized for handling a large amount of asteroids.
